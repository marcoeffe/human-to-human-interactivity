## Datasets
* [UT-Interaction dataset](http://cvrc.ece.utexas.edu/SDHA2010/Human_Interaction.html#Data) - The UT-Interaction dataset contains videos of continuous executions of 6 classes of human-human interactions: shake-hands, point, hug, push, kick and punch. Ground truth labels for these interactions are provided, including time intervals and bounding boxes.

## Action Recognition

* [Deep Learning for Videos: A 2018 Guide to Action Recognition](http://blog.qure.ai/notes/deep-learning-for-videos-action-recognition-review) - Summary of major landmark action recognition research papers till 2018

* [Human Action Recognition and Prediction: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.11230.pdf)

## Action Detection

* [Deep Learning for Detecting Multiple Space-Time Action Tubes in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01529) - It proposes an approach to the spatiotemporal localisation (detection) and classification of multiple concurrent human actions within temporally untrimmed videos.

## Action Progress

* [Am I Done? Predicting Action Progress in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01781) - Wwe introduce the problem of predicting human action progress in videos.

* [Human Action Forecasting by Learning Task Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06391) -  It proposes a novel deep recurrent architecture that takes as input features from a two-stream Residual action recognition framework, and learns to estimate the progress of human activities from video sequences.

## Miscellaneus

* [Deep SORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) - This repository contains code for Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric (Deep SORT). We extend the original SORT algorithm to integrate appearance information based on a deep appearance descriptor.
